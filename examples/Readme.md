# Alcelin usage examples
I have compiled together *some* examples that might get you started with using my library. I have not covered everything though, because you can just check out the documentations for all the stuff. This file is just an index for the examples.

**NOTE:** for all you reading: **Check [sm/to_string.cpp](sm/to_string.cpp) example before other examples.** This example contains info on how to use `sm::to_string` which is used in many other examples for ease.

## CU
- [cu/boundless_containers.cpp](cu/boundless_containers.cpp): How to use `cu::boundless_access` and boundless containers.
- [cu/enumerated_array.cpp](cu/enumerated_array.cpp): How to use CU's `cu::enumerated_array`.
- [cu/arithmetics.cpp](cu/arithmetics.cpp): How to use CU's container arithmetic functions.

## SM
- [sm/arithmetics.cpp](sm/arithmetics.cpp): How to use CU's string arithmetic functions.

## AEC
Example file noticeably absent, because it is too simple that you can just figure it out. Or check out [al_ansi_escape_codes.hpp](../include/al_ansi_escape_codes.hpp). There is a small example in the documentation.

## File
- [file/file_utilized.cpp](file/file_utilized.cpp): How to use File Utilities functions.
